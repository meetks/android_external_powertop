Needed between beta and 2.0 final
----------------------------------


* MUST use the 2.6.38 new stable tracepoints where available
* we're somehow broken on 64 bit. again.
* more translations / strings
* end user documentation
* investigate tick_sched_timer and why it wakes up
* find if we can do more detailed reporting about tasklet(softirq)
	* deal with tasklets -- needs kernel patch
* device events/sec into the process view
* USB urbs as events/sec counter
* check various tunables (see powertop 1.x) into a tunable checklist
  - needs porting over of all the powertop 1.x tunables:
	  - hpet timer? (is that still relevant?)
	  - tv out??
	  - noatime
* pretty print estimate to only do 2 decimal places instead of 3



postponed to 2.1
----------------
* CSV-output mode
* delta mode (Tony)
* audio calibration? Need appropriate sample
* have a "show me my process" page

done
----
* on NHM, cpu P state stats accumulate and don't reset at measurment time
* rescan for USB devices each measurement
* brightness calibration
* rfkill calibration
* wakeup calibration
* disk calibration
* in learning, find the biggest delta and only adjust that parameter, not 
  all of them as they go
* in learning, try slightly lower base power
* display device power in power top 20
* find out why CPU power and sum of components doesn't add up
* exclude xorg/etc from wakeup blame backcounting
* GPU ops in interrupt context -> do not account special ?
* try to see if we can account graphics ops done by X to the guy who woke up
  X
* don't save measurements < 5 seconds
* auto save every 10 or so measurements
* between 500 - 1000 measurements, start replacing (at random) existing ones
  with a hard cap at 1000
* network interfaces as device
* network interfaces -- packet counters as events
  from /proc/net/dev
* identify kernel threads in the process list for visual differentiation
* deal with the "no measurements" case better with default values
* add device runtime PM stats for pci, spi and i2c
* looks like events/sec keep adding up for processes
* Readable PCI names for runtime PM pci devices
* debug why wakeups sometimes go to all 0's
  -looks like I fixed it, keep an eye on it
* pretty print estimates to only show 2 significant places cleanly
* pretty print various kernel pieces
* deal with debugfs not being in /sys/kernel/debug
* if you plug in the AC during a run, the battery code is not detecting that
* status bar at the bottom
* health report (reporting mode, not interactive) needs to include devices that don't support runtime PM
* for unknown USB devices, list VID/PID
* move the 2 data files somewhere sane
* inode dirty trace point
* find out why CPU %age and C state C0 %age don't mesh sometimes
* "report" mode
* detect missing kernel options for PERF / too old kernels and report
  something helpful to the user
* detect not running as root and exit gracefully
* usage documentation / readme sufficient for people to get going
* internationalization!
* show "enter" is a toggle key in the tunables tab
* lsof to show who is keeping the audio busy 
* Add battery time left estimation back
* there is a filedescriptor leak! -- or so it seems. Can't reproduce the
  report anymore
* find "underlying device" and group power by that in the overview
* htmlize UTF8 mu
* fix memory leaks
	 -- growth in memory seems to not be there.. it's just exit leaks...
	    yawn.
